How many external displays can I connect through the docking station?
All of our docking stations allow as many displays as the MacBook can

more displays than your MacBook is capable of outputting to.  As of
the writing of this article, that is between one and four displays
depending on the specific MacBook.  If you are unsure how many displays
your MacBook can output to you can look up your specific model here.[1]
